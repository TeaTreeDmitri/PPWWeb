            <h3>Pico Picante</h3>
            <p>Frameworks are importable into a JS file, that basically take the default values of the html and replace
                them with a ‘prefaced’ CSS file. This means it can take care of some repetitative tasks, components that
                are very common between projects, such as carousels, hamburger menus etc, and save the developer the
                time of writing the same code that has already been written thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of
                times.

                There are many different flavours of frameworks, in this project I chose to use Pico, as it’s small
                lightweight package size and basic styling allows for easier adjustments, and isn’t so dogmatic as
                something like Bootstrap, which also makes everything look hideous.

                The styling in the example is almost unchanged from the Pico default, it’s rendered in ‘dark mode’
                because of the preference of my personal browser.

                It does a fantastic job of creating a usable webpage in literal seconds.
