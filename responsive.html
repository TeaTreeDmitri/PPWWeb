                For the most part, using responsive values such as max or min took care of the responsively of the layout between large and medium desktop sizes. 

however the design did break around 650px so a single media query was used. The function of this media query was MAINLY to switch from display:grid layouts to display: flex layouts. As when a layout is adapted for mobile it is primarily a single column layout, something flex is very good at.

The flex- direction was also changed so that they stack vertically in a single column as opposed to flex-direction: row when theyâ€™d be side by side.

The advantage of this approach is that the layouts WITHIN components are preserved, so often only the containers need adapting.

See below for examples: </p>
